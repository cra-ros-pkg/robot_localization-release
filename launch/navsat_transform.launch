<!-- Launch file for navsat_transform_node -->

<!--
     This node requires three inputs:
     (1) A sensor_msgs/Imu message with a magnetometer-based absolute heading (yaw).
     (2) A nav_msgs/Odometry message that contains the robot's current position estimate in the frame specified by its start
         location. This should just be the output of robot_localization. NOTE: if the use_odometry_yaw parameter is set to
         true, the IMU message in (1) is not required.
     (3) A sensor_msgs/NavSatfix message that contains the robot's current raw GPS position, along with relevant meta data
         regarding fix quality.

     The output of this node is an odometry message that contains the GPS data transformed into the robot's world coordinate
     frame (i.e., the frame specified by input (2)'s frame_id).

           IMU data is reported in the ENU frame. Many IMUs report data in the NED frame,
           so you'll want to verify that your data is in the correct frame before using it.  -->

      <!-- If your IMU does not account for magnetic declination, enter the value for your
           location here. If you don't know it, see http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag-web/
           (make sure to convert the value to radians). This parameter is mandatory. -->

      <!-- Your IMU's yaw, once the magentic_declination_radians value is added to it, should
           report 0 when facing east. If it doesn't, enter the offset here. Defaults to 0. -->

      <!-- If this is true, all received odometry data is converted back to a lat/lon

      <!-- If this is true, the node ignores the IMU data and gets its heading from the
           odometry source (typically the /odometry/filtered topic coming from one of
           robot_localization's state estimation nodes). BE CAREFUL when using this!
           The yaw value in your odometry source *must* be world-referenced, e.g., you
           cannot use your odometry source for yaw if you have only one source for yaw
           data and it has its differential or relative parameter set to true. Defaults
           to false. -->
